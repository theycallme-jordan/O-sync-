# 🖥️ OSync: Page Replacement & Scheduling Simulator

**OSync** is an interactive, web-based simulator built to simplify the learning of complex Operating System concepts like **Page Replacement** and **Process Scheduling Algorithms**. Developed as a student project by Team B1tz, OSync provides a hands-on environment where learners can input parameters, run simulations, and visually track the execution of algorithms in real-time.

## 📚 Motivation

Understanding operating system algorithms such as FIFO, LRU, Round Robin, and SJF can be challenging due to their abstract nature. Traditional methods like lectures and slides offer limited engagement. **OSync bridges this gap by providing an interactive and visual learning tool**, making these core concepts accessible and intuitive for students.
